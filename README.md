# Retail-sql-python-
This end-to-end data analytics project focuses on analyzing a retail orders dataset downloaded from Kaggle. The project walks through the complete data lifecycle — from data acquisition, preprocessing, and cleaning using Pandas, to storing the cleaned data in SQL Server. Finally, we extract valuable business insights by writing SQL queries to answer key analytical questions.


**Key Steps:**

Data Collection: Retail orders dataset sourced from Kaggle.

Data Processing & Cleaning: Handled using Python and Pandas — null values, data types, duplicates, and formatting.

Data Loading: Loaded the cleaned dataset into a SQL Server database using SQLAlchemy.

SQL Analysis: Answered business-relevant questions using SQL queries to uncover trends, product performance, sales insights, and more.
